Last year, this dedicated team of students played a vital role in the success of our student activity, contributing their time, energy, and creativity to make it thrive. Now, having gained valuable experience and insight, they’ve returned—not as participants, but as mentors and supporters for the current generation. Whether it's offering guidance, sharing lessons learned, or simply being there to lend a hand, they’re committed to helping this year’s team reach even greater heights. Their continued involvement reflects their passion for the activity and their belief in the power of student collaboration and growth.
