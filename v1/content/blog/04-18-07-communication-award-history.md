For the past years, one of the main goals of our team was to win the communication award. Each & every one of our team was determined to make this work.

 Gladly, this goal was achieved at 2015, 2021 & 2022

 In 2015 we won the 1st place in the competition. 

We rejoined the competition in 2021 & 2022 & won the 2nd place and here’s a glimpse of our journey.

As an “eco-racing team” we make sure to spread the concept of an eco-friendly environment. Our goal was to target all age categories.

So, we started with the youth and visited MILS, MES & STEM schools, showing them our eco-friendly vesicles.

 In 2020 we faced a major challenge “COVID-19”, But as CUERT nothing could stop us, even the lockdown.

So we started an online awareness campaign from our home that reached a lot of people.

We were lucky enough to get the chance to show our vehicles at the YLF leader’s league & EBDAA competition to The Minister of Youth Ashraf Sobhy, The Egyptian Minister of High Education Khaled Abd Elghafar & the young businessman Ahmed abo hashima!

Not only this but also many successful TV channels showed a huge interest in our vehicles & featured us to talk about our projects as “Al Hayah”, “Al Oula”, “Al Tanya”, “DMC”, “Ten TV”.

The next step was our recruitment campaign. 437 applicants were interested in joining our team which means a lot to us

And after a series of successions, we decided to share it in the right place. So we made our annual visit to 57357 & did a lot of fun activities with the children.

In addition to our offline activities, we make sure to document our journey using our platforms. So you’ll find us always active on Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn & youtube.
