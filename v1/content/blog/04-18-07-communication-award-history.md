In the pursuit of excellence, the Cairo University Eco Racing Team (CUERT) has set a significant goal over the past few years – winning the coveted Communication Award. Each member of our dedicated team has been resolute in turning this aspiration into reality, and we are proud to say that our collective efforts have borne fruit in 2015, 2021, and 2022.

In the inaugural year of 2015, CUERT secured the 1st place in the competition, a testament to our commitment to innovation and sustainability. Undeterred by challenges, we rejoined the competition in 2021 and 2022, achieving the 2nd place on both occasions. This consistent success underscores our team's dedication and expertise in the world of eco-racing.

As an "eco-racing team," our mission goes beyond winning accolades – we aim to spread the concept of an eco-friendly environment, reaching audiences across all age groups. Initiating our outreach efforts with the youth, we visited MILS, MES, and STEM schools, presenting and explaining the intricacies of our eco-friendly vehicles.

The year 2020 brought a unique challenge in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, true to CUERT's spirit, we adapted and overcame. Even in the face of lockdowns, our team launched an impactful online awareness campaign from the confines of our homes, reaching a substantial audience and maintaining our commitment to environmental consciousness.

Our dedication garnered us an opportunity to showcase our vehicles at prestigious events like the YLF Leader's League and EBDAA competition, where we had the honor of presenting our work to esteemed guests, including the Minister of Youth Ashraf Sobhy, the Egyptian Minister of Higher Education Khaled Abd Elghafar, and the young businessman Ahmed Abo Hashima.

The recognition didn't stop there. Prominent TV channels, such as "Al Hayah," "Al Oula," "Al Tanya," "DMC," and "Ten TV," expressed a keen interest in our vehicles and featured us, providing a platform to discuss our projects and share our vision for a sustainable future.

The journey continued with a successful recruitment campaign, attracting 437 eager applicants who share our passion for innovation and environmental responsibility. This influx of interest is a testament to the growing impact and influence of CUERT within the community.

Celebrating our victories is important, but CUERT believes in giving back. Our annual visit to 57357 involved engaging activities with children, spreading joy and making a positive impact beyond the racetrack.

In addition to our offline endeavors, CUERT diligently documents our journey through various platforms, ensuring our presence on Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube. These outlets serve as windows into our world, allowing us to share our triumphs, challenges, and the core values that drive our team.

CUERT's commitment to excellence, innovation, and community impact remains unwavering. The journey with the Communication Award is not just about winning accolades; it's about leaving a lasting legacy of eco-friendly practices and inspiring others to join us in building a sustainable future.
