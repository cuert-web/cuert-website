A Shell Eco-Marathon Challenge.  

  STEM students from around the world were challenged on a mission to design a sustainable, energy-efficient car that is designed for the modern world. “With imagination as the only limit, how will an iconic car of the '80s inspire the car of the future once again?”. 

  AVIC.   

So, the team unleashed their creativity in this challenge. THEY MADE AVIC. AVIC, a car from the future. He was developed to eliminate any problems a human face on a daily basis. The car body system is designed to increase downforce grip and achieve the most aerodynamic shape.   Most of his parts are made of carbon- kevlar composite monocoque to minimize weight and increase strength, the tires are airless making it safer since no air pressure is used and decreased rubber consumption.  You might have noticed the car was referred to as a “he” it was actually intentional because AVICS’s super intelligence allows him to understand  any spoken language on his database so he isn't only able to study the personality of the driver but also connects to your smart home system and monitors different home appliances and systems, he can also detect the user’s voice so it won't operate for other divers unless he says the password set by the car owner.  The car automatically activates self-driving mode and heads towards the nearest hospital in case of any changes in the driver’s vitals.   

 The Result.

 In an impressive display of talent and determination, our team clinched the coveted first place among a multitude of competing teams (EUROUPE and AFRICA). Facing stiff competition from numerous contenders, our team's exceptional skills, unwavering teamwork, and sheer dedication propelled us to the top position. This remarkable achievement not only reflects our team's relentless effort but also highlights our commitment to excellence. We are incredibly proud of this accomplishment and look forward to building on this success in future endeavors.
