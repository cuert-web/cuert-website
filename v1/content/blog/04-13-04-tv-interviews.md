Who can deny the crucial effect of media on our daily life? The media has a great influence on simply everything. Media influence refers to the power and impact that various forms of media, such as television, newspapers, and the internet have on shaping public opinion and behaviors. The media plays a significant role in shaping our perceptions of the world, influencing our beliefs, values, and decision-making processes.
The communication is a priority for our team just as the technical aspects of the team. As we care about racing and environment via trying to run the longest distance by the least amount possible of energy, We also care to be engaged with the society. Our team always tries to reach out to a large segment of people out there not just our colleagues. You can notice that on our TV interviews and media contributions.
