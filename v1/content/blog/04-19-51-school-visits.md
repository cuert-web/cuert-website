One of our team’s main goals is to inspire people and ourselves to work for a better future, a better place to live in, a better environment. For us, we see that the best minds to interact with our ideas and encourage to move forward and help are the young.
We chose to visit schools, where minds are built, to help students understand the importance of protecting and cleaning the environment around us. On the ninth of march, 2022, our team visited MILS school. 

We wanted to show the students how we work on our cars and how we maintain the highest level of green use of energy. We also talked about how all the university majors nowadays are starting to teach environmental protection measures, each according to their field. 

We also showed them our car and taught them a bit about how we maintain those measures and why it is so important. We then talked about how we manage to participate in the Shell Eco-Marathon and how we actually won and got ranked over teams from all over the world in more than a competition.

We found a great deal of interest from the students towards the topic which encouraged us for more visits to come, for schools or fairs, anywhere we could cause a young brain to understand the importance and the influence of taking a step towards a better and cleaner life.
