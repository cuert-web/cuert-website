In the grand tapestry of our team's ambitions, one prominent thread weaves through â€“ inspiring individuals and ourselves to contribute to a better future, a better living space, and a better environment. Recognizing the pivotal role of young minds in shaping the future, we've embarked on a mission to interact with and encourage the youth, fostering a sense of responsibility toward our planet.

Schools, as the crucibles where young minds are forged, became our chosen avenue for spreading awareness. On the ninth of March 2022, our team embarked on a meaningful visit to MILS school, eager to impart valuable insights about environmental protection and sustainability.

Our goal was to provide students with a firsthand look at our work on eco-friendly cars, showcasing the meticulous efforts we undertake to maintain the highest standards of green energy usage. During our visit, we engaged students in discussions about the evolving landscape of university majors, emphasizing the incorporation of environmental protection measures into diverse academic disciplines.

The focal point of our presentation was our eco-friendly vehicle. We elucidated on the measures we implement to uphold environmental standards and elucidated why such practices are integral. The students gained insights into our journey, from the meticulous preparations to our triumphant participation in the Shell Eco-Marathon, where we not only competed but also achieved commendable rankings against teams from around the globe.

The enthusiastic response from the students during our visit to MILS school fueled our determination for future engagements. We sensed a genuine interest in the topics we discussed, motivating us to plan additional visits to schools, fairs, and any platform where young minds could grasp the importance and influence of taking steps toward a cleaner, better life.

CUERT's commitment goes beyond the racetrack. It extends to nurturing a generation of environmentally conscious individuals who understand the significance of their actions in shaping a sustainable future. Through our educational initiatives, we aim to plant the seeds of awareness and responsibility, fostering a collective dedication to a cleaner and greener world.
